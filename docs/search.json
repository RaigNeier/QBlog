    "text": "About Author\nHello, my name is Peter aka Raig Neier. For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by electronics. It’s like some kind of magic that once built work by itself. But most of all I enjoyed programming it and especially the games.\nMy interest was first piqued by a Nintendo game console that I borrowed from a friend for a few months when he moved to another city. Sometimes I think what is so special about Super Mario? But as the first game in my life after TETRIS, it made an indelible impression on me. Then it was SEGA, then the computer and the first book on Turbo Pascal.\nI’ve always been fascinated by how in games the story came to life and moved, but you could also influence it. It turned out to be much more interesting than reading or watching movies. And now I’m stuck for life trying to figure out how to learn this magic=)"

    "text": "Welcome to my game development blog!\nIn this blog, I want to share my little experiments in game programming. My goal is do not do it right, but to do it interesting.\nThe methods and tools that I use may seem outdated to some, but there are reasons for this. I value compilation and execution speed, rapid prototyping, convenience and code readability the most. After we were able to convey the general idea, the code can be easily translated into suitable tools for this. But at first those tools can distract from the original idea.\nI will not strive to make the complexity of the lessons consistent, those kind of lessons already exist, but I will use sophisticated methods straight away and explain them.\nI hope you get something useful for yourself.\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello and Welcome!\");"
